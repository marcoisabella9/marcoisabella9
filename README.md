# About Me
I am Marco Isabella, a second year student at The Pennsylvania State University in Abington pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
<br><br>
I'm currently seeking an internship for the summer of 2024 following my passion for software development.
<br><br>
Throughout high school I took an interest to programming and learned Python and Java through my school's computer science courses, including AP Computer Science. Recently I have begun to take interest in frontend development and am working to translate my skills to HTML5, Javascript, and CSS.
<br><br>
Outside the realm of Computer Science, I am a Division III NCAA Cross Country and Track and Field Athlete, maintaining discipline throughout all aspects of my life.
